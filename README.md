🙋🏼‍♀️ Ciao! I'm @cowoakvalley, but you can call me Karo (as in Karoline)
🇩🇰 I'm a brave Dane who ventured into the world of software!
👩🏼‍💻 Currently learning front-end development from @shecodes.io
🌈 But curious on all aspects of coding
💬 Figured it'd be good combination with my degree in Communications
📬 You can reach me on kdegelund@gmail.com
