🙋🏼‍♀️ Ciao! I'm @cowoakvalley, but you can call me Karo (as in Karoline) <br>
🇩🇰 I'm a brave Dane who ventured into the world of software! <br>
👩🏼‍💻 Currently learning front-end development from @shecodes.io <br>
🌈 But curious on all aspects of coding <br>
💬 Figured it'd be good combination with my degree in Communications <br>
📬 You can reach me on kdegelund@gmail.com <br>
